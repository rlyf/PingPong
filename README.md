# PingPong

A remake of the classic retro game named Pong that was made by a crappy programmer that does not know how to use Github well, rlyf. (he sucks)

Hope you enjoy this badly made game and not die from cringe


If you do plan to play the game, here are the rules of it:
1. Do not question if the ball clips into your paddle as it does not have collision for the top and bottom of the paddle.
2. Bounce the ball with your paddle (Red paddle control with arrow keys, Blue padde control with W and S keys)
3. The aim is to bounce the ball to the other player's side.
4. Score is calculated based on the number of bounces you've made.
